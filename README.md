# [hyper.rs][] benchmarks

Performance benchmarks for [hyper.rs][].

There's not too much point in listing results here, that will just get stale. Instead, you can look at [TechEmpower's benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) to see a big comparison of web frameworks across a bunch of languages.

**Spoilers:** hyper is one of the **fastest** *complete* HTTP implementations!

*(Most that are faster (and just barely) tend to skip various important details of HTTP/1.1 that users need to worry about themsevles.)*
