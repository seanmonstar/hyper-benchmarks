# [hyper.rs][] benchmarks

Performance benchmarks for [hyper.rs][].

There's not too much point in listing results here, that will just get stale. Instead, you can look at [TechEmpower's benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) to see a big comparison of web frameworks across a bunch of languages.

**Note**: The benchmarks website shows a snapshot every 6ish months. [hyper v0.12 was released](http://seanmonstar.com/post/174480374517/hyper-v012) (with *large* improvements) a couple days after the latest snapshot. [Later benchmarks include hyper at v0.12](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=bebca46e-899f-4958-8052-d5f5f5c81eb2&hw=ph&test=plaintext), helping show hyper is one of the fastest *complete** HTTP implementations!

*(Most that are faster (and just barely) tend to skip various important details of HTTP/1.1 that users need to worry about themsevles.)*
